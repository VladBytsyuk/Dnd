        You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an 
        intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering 
        sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric â€” 
        performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.

        Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature 
        of your religious service. The Gods article contains a sample pantheon. Were you a lesser functionary in a 
        temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly 
        experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of 
        any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.
